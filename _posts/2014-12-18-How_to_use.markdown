This is a simple Jekyll template that makes it easy to use Jekyll on
Github pages as a documentation platform resembling wiki but with more
control.

  * Uses Github's online editor to edit pages
  * Uses Github's revision control for the pages
  * Let's users to fork, do changes and make pull requests
  * You can use Github's settings to easily determine who has admin access

You can use everything a normal !(Jekyll)[http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home] project can.

## Adding content
All pages have an `Add` button. Clicking that you will be able to add a new
page to the current structure. If you don't have permissions to do so then
the project can be forked and once you added the content you can make a pull
request.

## Editing
Pressing on `Edit` on a page will simply take you to Github's editor 
for the specific page where you are now. As with `Add`, if you don't
have permissions to do so (you are not an admin of the project), 

## Adding collaborators
Editing pages is the same as editing source code of a project on Github. For that reason
whenever a random user clicks on Edit, a message to fork the project will be given. If the
user forks the project, then he can pull a request to merge.

If you want specific users to be able and freely edit content without this process,
then you simply have to add these users as collaborators to the project.
