This is a simple Jekyll template that can be used as a starting point for Documentation of your project.

## Adding content
To add a new page you simply click on Add from wherever you might be. All pages can be 
found inside the folder `_posts`.

As you might notice all content is markdown syntax. Also allowed is `liquid syntax` in 
case you want to access [Jekyll's variables]().

Also you can use `liquid syntax` to highlight code.
For example:
{% highlight python %}
def test(name):
  print('test')
{% endhighlight %}

## Editing
Pressing on `edit` (on the right upper corner) will simply take you to Github's editor 
for the specific page where you are now.

## Adding collaborators
Editing pages is the same as editing source code of a project on Github. For that reason
whenever a random user clicks on Edit, a message to fork the project will be given. If the
user forks the project, then he can pull a request to merge.

If you want specific users to be able and freely edit content without this process,
then you simply have to add these users as collaborators to the project.
