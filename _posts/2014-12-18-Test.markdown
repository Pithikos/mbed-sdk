# This is a test

This is a simple Jekyll template that makes it easy to use Jekyll on
Github pages as a documentation platform resembling wiki but with more
control.

  * Uses Github's online editor to edit and add pages
  * Uses Github's revision control for the pages
  * Let's users to fork, do changes and make pull requests
  * You can use Github's settings to easily administer access

You can use everything a normal [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home) project can.

## Install
  
  1. Make a github web page
  2. Click here.

## Adding collaborators
Editing pages is the same as editing source code of a project on Github. For that reason
whenever a random user clicks on Edit, a message to fork the project will be given. If the
user forks the project, then he can pull a request to merge.

If you want specific users to be able and freely edit content without this process,
then you simply have to add these users as collaborators to the project.
