{"name":"Mbed-sdk","tagline":"test","body":"###What’s the Mbed SDK?\r\nLet’s start by saying that the Mbed SDK is simply a library. It just happens that it is very concise and simple. Furthermore since Mbed is backed by ARM, there is always an assurance that a vast number of microcontrollers will be Mbed compatible. That simply means that the guys who make the microcontrollers got to an agreement with Mbed and follow some rules that the Mbed team sets, like that there should be a virtual serial port, the port should allow some specific commands, that the microcontroller should be seen as a storage disk etc. Also it states that the microcontroller is allowed to use one of a specific set of ARM CPUs.\r\n\r\n\r\n###What’s the Mbed API?\r\nDo the below:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/mbedmicro/mbed\r\n    cd mbed\r\n\r\nNow there is a folder libraries/mbed/api. This folder contains the headers of the whole Mbed library (remember Mbed SDK = Mbed library). The whole library is written in C++ so the API can be seen by reading the header files (*.h), just like in C.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
