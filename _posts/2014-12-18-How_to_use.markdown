# How to use (updated2)

You only need to configure your `_config.yml` file so it reflects your
project.

The below fields have to be correct for this template to work:

  1. `github_project-name`
  2. `github_username`


## Content
All content is saved in _posts. The content there can be organized with
folders. Markdown files that are in the same folder are treated as belonging
to the same documentation snippet and accordingly the navigation panel
will be populated.


## Adding collaborators
Editing pages is the same as editing source code of a project on Github. For that reason
whenever a random user clicks on Edit, a message to fork the project will be given. If the
user forks the project, then he can pull a request to merge.

If you want specific users to be able and freely edit content without this process,
then you simply have to add these users as collaborators to the project.


## What's next?
You can start by going to the root and start adding content. You can safely
delete this file.
